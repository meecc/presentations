The directly linked presentations listed below *should* autorun when you click the corresponding Binder button. The autorun is configured via the RISE extension settings in `.jupyter/nbconfig/rise.json`.

The [RISE chalkboard](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/maint-5.5/customize.html#enable-chalkboard-capabilities) is also pre-enabled, so you should be able to draw on the slides. (Hit the `-` button to delete highlights added to the current slide.)
